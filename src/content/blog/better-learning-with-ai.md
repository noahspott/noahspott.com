# Don't just give me answers! Learning better with AI.

Today, I discovered a cool new way to learn with Claude with this simple yet effective prompt strategy:

```
<Insert your question here>

Help me LEARN. Don't just give me answers. Give me small pieces of information and guide me with questions to arrive at the answer."
```

While working on today's Advent of TypeScript challenge, I felt I needed more guidance after viewing the hint. But, I didn't want Claude to just give me the answer.

With this prompt, the LLM didn't just dump code; it asked me technical questions to lead me to the solution:

<div class="ai-response">

Great question! Let's explore this step by step, and I'll help you discover how to create a "newable" object in JavaScript.

First, let me ask you: What do you already know about constructor functions in JavaScript?

Think about these questions:

- Have you ever seen a function that starts with a capital letter?
- Do you know what the `this` keyword does in a function context?
- Are you familiar with how the `new` keyword works when creating objects?

Let's start by exploring a basic constructor function. Can you tell me what you think might be different about a function that's designed to be used with `new` compared to a regular function?

This Socratic method of learning pushed me to:

- Articulate my existing knowledge
- Explore nuanced technical concepts
- Understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind JavaScript's object creation

Key insights emerged:

- I learned how forgetting `new` can accidentally pollute the global object
- I understood the evolution from constructor functions to ES6 classes
- I saw how TypeScript adds an extra layer of type safety to object creation

The beauty of this approach? It's not about getting quick answers, but about developing a deeper, more intuitive understanding of technology.

To my fellow developers and self-learners: Try out this learning technique. Ask for guidance, not just answers. Embrace curiosity, ask questions, and let the learning process unfold organically.
